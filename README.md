<h1>Database Inventory Project</h1>

<p>This project aims to compare two different approaches for building a database inventory system: relational and recursive. The database inventory system serves as a tool to manage and keep track of various items, their locations, and other relevant information within a home.</p>

        <h2>Relational Approach</h2>
        <p>This approach involves structuring the inventory database using traditional relational database principles, where data is organized into tables with predefined relationships between them.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 45%;">
        <h2>Recursive Approach</h2>
        <p>The recursive approach utilizes recursive data structures to model the inventory system, allowing for more flexible and dynamic organization of inventory items and their relationships.</p>
